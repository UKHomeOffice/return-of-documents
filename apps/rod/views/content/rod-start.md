## Before you start

You will need:

- details of the documents (holder’s name, nationality and date of birth)

- a reference number from the application (payment reference, courier number, case ID, unique application number or Home Office reference number)

- the date the application was submitted

- the main applicant’s details

If you do not do anything for 30 minutes, your answers will not be saved. Your answers are only saved when you submit the form.
