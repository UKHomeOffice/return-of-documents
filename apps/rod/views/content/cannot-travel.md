If you do not want to cancel the application then you can only use a returned passport to prove identity.

The Home Office may cancel, void or refuse your application if you use a returned passport to travel outside of:

- the UK
- the Republic of Ireland
- the Channel Islands
- the Isle of Man

If you travel you may also be unable to re-enter the UK.
